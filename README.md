## Project Dependencies
This automation depends on two additional projects:
1. [**Quick Form Fill Backend**](https://github.com/esperanca-leonardo/quick-form-fill-backend)
    - This backend project provides the necessary API endpoints and handles the server-side logic required by the automation.
    - Ensure you follow the installation and setup instructions provided in the `README.md` of the backend repository to get it up and running.

2. **Frontend Project**: [Your Frontend Repository](https://github.com/your-username/frontend-repo)
    - This frontend project provides the user interface where the forms are located and filled by the automation.
    - Ensure the frontend project is properly set up and running according to its documentation.

Ensure both the backend and frontend projects are running and accessible before using the Quick Form Fill automation.
